Title: Generate Profiles from ACS Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Camille Seaberry, DataHaven
Description: Functions that were developed in-house for generating profiles of
    ACS data for neighborhoods, towns, and regions. Includes functions for
    making combined ACS geo.set objects for aggregating data over groups of 
    block groups, tracts, towns, etc. As a warning, service from the Census API
    can be spotty--nothing we can do about that one. Use of ACS package
    requires an API key, which can be set with `api.key.install`.
